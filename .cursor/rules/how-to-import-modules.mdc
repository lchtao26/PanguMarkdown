1. Always check `package.json` first to see if there are existing dependencies that can help implement your feature
2. Avoid adding new dependencies if existing ones can provide similar functionality
3. Leverage built-in capabilities of current libraries before implementing custom solutions
4. Use shadcn/ui primitives from `@/components/ui` when possible
